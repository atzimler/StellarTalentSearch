Initial notes - I took this as a learning project given the circumstances.

TODO:

- Creating automatically a self signed certificate in the container.
- Add authentication, research what would be an easy way to add auth as an independent slice
- Add database to as docker compose backend.
- 

To document:
- Setting up the development docker environment -> talent.stellar hosts
- Starting the container environment
